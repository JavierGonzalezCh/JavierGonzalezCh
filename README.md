## 👋 About Me

I'm a **Fullstack Developer** with a strong focus on **backend development** and a passion for building complete, scalable, and maintainable digital experiences.

I specialize in designing and implementing **RESTful APIs**, integrating external services, automating workflows, and deploying cloud-based applications. I have hands-on experience leading full-cycle development: from **planning and architecture** to **implementation, testing**, and **production delivery**.

I'm committed to **clean code**, **best practices** (such as Clean Architecture and SOLID principles), and **continuous learning**. My technology toolkit includes **.NET**, **Node.js**, **React**, **SQL Server**, **Docker**, and more.
